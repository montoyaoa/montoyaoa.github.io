So, this is my last semester of my undergrad. I am, at this point, conflicted about which direction to focus my career. I like hardware, a lot. I developed an interest in Arduino projects early and it really has stuck to me. Planning out a circuit, breadboarding it, building a PCB prototype and making it work is great to me. I am "lucky" in a way to have one more year as a master's student to really figure out my niche.

Perhaps the best way to describe my interest in software is that I like having something *real*, something physical that I can see be affected by the code I write. Because of that I think something like firmware engineering or embedded systems engineering would work well for me. I have an idea of what my future looks like, but it's still cloudy.

Unfortunately, something I've noticed is that Web development is vastly overrepresented when searching for software engineering career information. I would like to learn more about what a career as an Embedded Systems engineer would be like. In the meantime, I am glad to be learning more about web dev, which has been foreign to me.

Something I have trouble with is understanding a large codebase that has been handed to me to understand. For me, it is very easy to become overwhelmed. I think I would need to improve that sort of "teamwork" skill.
