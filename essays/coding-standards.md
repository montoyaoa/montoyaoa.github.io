I had figured there was some way of enforcing code standards, but I didn't know much about how it was implemented. In the overwhelming majority of the code I have written, I just wrote what worked, without worrying about tabs, spaces, or where the curly brace is. I recognize then and now that that isn't a good idea for code I intend to share with others.

After trying ESLint to enforce Javascript coding standards, I feel that I can more easily write code with a consistent syntax. To me, it's easy now that I know useful keyboard shortcuts: `F2` for moving to the next suggestion, and `Alt + Enter` to take the suggested corrective action. By doing so, I feel confident that I can achieve the green checkmark easily.
