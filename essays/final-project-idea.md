# Project Idea: Bountiful Harvest

## Overview
*The problem*: Home gardeners who grow food often are overwhelmed when their crops are ready for harvest. Although some amount is consumed for personal use, much is wasted or thrown away. This food waste could be put to better use, helping Hawaii's food resiliency with locally grown agriculture.

*The solution*: The Bountiful Harvest application allows growers of all sizes, from full-scale farms to suburban gardeners, to share their harvested food crops. Users can login and create a profile indicating what foods they have, when they are in season, and where they can meet to distribute food. 

## Approach
Once a profile is created, other users can browse profiles based on the foods they prefer. These profiles also show upcoming harvest information, if available.

Users can also subscribe to notifications when the food they desire is available, and propose trades using the food they have available.

Admins can monitor the site for inappropriate content, and create new categories of foods and exchange locations.

Some mockup pages include:

- Landing page
- User home page
- Admin home page
- User profile page.
- Browse exchange locations
- Browse foods

## Use case ideas
Whether or not the following bullet points list all pages or not, the completed use case should show an end-to-end scenario of using the system.

- New user goes to landing page, logs in, gets home page, sets up profile with location and foods available.
- Admin goes to landing page, logs in, gets home page, edits site.
- User goes to landing page, logs in, finds user offering particular food, contacts them.

## Beyond the basics
After implementing the basic functionality, here are ideas for more advanced features:

- Suggest recipes based on nearby available foods
- Suggest food crops that could be grown based on demand and climate
