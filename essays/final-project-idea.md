# Project Idea: Bountiful Harvest

## Overview
*The problem*: Home gardeners who grow food often are overwhelmed when their crops are ready for harvest. Although some amount is consumed for personal use, much is wasted or thrown away. This food waste could be put to better use, helping Hawaii's food resiliency with locally grown agriculture.

*The solution*: The Bountiful Harvest application allows growers of all sizes, from full-scale farms to suburban gardeners, to share their harvested food crops. Users can login and create a profile indicating what foods they have, when they are in season, and where they can meet to distribute food. 

## Approach
Once a profile is created, other users can browse profiles based on the foods they prefer. These profiles also show upcoming harvest information, if available.

Users can also 

Once a profile is created, others can browse the profiles filtered by specific tastes, capabilities, and goals to find compatible musicians to contact.

Students can also set up notifications to find out automatically when a profile is created that satisfies criteria that they specify.

Admins can monitor the site for inappropriate content, and create new categories of musical tastes, capabilities, and goals.

Note: if you choose this idea for your final project, you cannot name it “Campus Jam”. Come up with a different name for your final project.

Some mockup pages include:

- Landing page
- User home page
- Admin home page
- User profile page.
- Browse users by taste, ability, instrument, goals, etc.

## Use case ideas
Whether or not the following bullet points list all pages or not, the completed use case should show an end-to-end scenario of using the system.

- New user goes to landing page, logs in, gets home page, sets up profile. (How do they learn how system works?)
- Admin goes to landing page, logs in, gets home page, edits site.
- User goes to landing page, logs in, finds musicians with compatible interests, contacts them.

## Beyond the basics
After implementing the basic functionality, here are ideas for more advanced features:

- Support the organization of jam sessions. Provide information on scheduled jam sessions, including location, time, musical type, desired capabilities, and organizer contact information.
- Support a network of “who’s played with who”.
- Support reviews of musicians.
